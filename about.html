          <h3>Concept</h3>
          <p>
            At the heart of “Press Play” is the idea that art should be a
            participatory experience. By blending various digital mediums, the
            exhibition aims to challenge traditional boundaries between creator
            and viewer, inviting audiences to play, explore, and interact with
            the artworks in innovative ways.
          </p>

          <h3>Artistic Vision</h3>
          <p>
            This exhibition showcases a diverse range of works, including
            interactive installations, video art, and 3-dimensional. Each piece
            is designed to provoke thought, inspire creativity, and foster a
            sense of community among participants. “Press Play” is not just an
            exhibition; it is an invitation to enter a new realm of artistic
            expression and exploration.
