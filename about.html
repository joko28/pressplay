        <h2>About the Exhibition</h2>
        <p>
          “Press Play” is a digital media exhibition that explores the
          interactive and immersive nature of art in the digital age. The
          exhibition invites audiences to engage with the works presented,
          encouraging them to become active participants in the artistic
          experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>
          At the heart of “Press Play” is the idea that art should be a
          participatory experience. By blending various digital mediums, the
          exhibition aims to challenge traditional boundaries between creator
          and viewer, inviting audiences to play, explore, and interact with the
          artworks in innovative ways.
        </p>

        <h3>Artistic Vision</h3>
        <p>
          This exhibition showcases a diverse range of works, including
          interactive installations, video art, and 3-dimensional. Each piece is
          designed to provoke thought, inspire creativity, and foster a sense of
          community among participants. “Press Play” is not just an exhibition;
          it is an invitation to enter a new realm of artistic expression and
          exploration.
